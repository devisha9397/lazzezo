PHP Pagination
This is a guide how to create a pagination using PHP and MySQL.
Overview

This is a script to make pagination in PHP like digg.com or flickr.com. This script was written by a guy from Stranger Studios.

In this page I've edit the script a little bit to make it working and easy to edit. You can grab the original script at Digg-Style Pagination.

My tutorial is just a guide how to implemente in your PHP script. The image below is what you'll get after finished this code.
PHP Pagination Script
STEP1: The Code

Grab the code and paste in your text editor.
You have to customize 7 spots in this code (see images below).

1. Code to connect to your DB - place or include your code to connect to database.
2. $tbl_name - your table name.
3. $adjacents - how many adjacent pages should be shown on each side.
4. $targetpage - is the name of file ex. I saved this file as pagination.php, my $targetpage should be "pagination.php".
5. $limit - how many items to show per page.
6. "SELECT column_name - change to your own column.
7. Replace your own while..loop here - place your code to echo results here.

After all, save and test your script.

############### Code

<?php
	/*
		Place code to connect to your DB here.
	*/
	include('database.php');	// include your code to connect to DB.

	$tbl_name="";		//your table name
	// How many adjacent pages should be shown on each side?
	$adjacents = 3;
	
	/* 
	   First get total number of rows in data table. 
	   If you have a WHERE clause in your query, make sure you mirror it here.
	*/
	$query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as num FROM $tbl_name";
	$total_pages = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query($query));
	$total_pages = $total_pages[num];
	
	/* Setup vars for query. */
	$targetpage = "filename.php"; 	//your file name  (the name of this file)
	$limit = 2; 								//how many items to show per page
	$page = $_GET['page'];
	if($page) 
		$start = ($page - 1) * $limit; 			//first item to display on this page
	else
		$start = 0;								//if no page var is given, set start to 0
	
	/* Get data. */
	$sql = "SELECT column_name FROM $tbl_name LIMIT $start, $limit";
	$result = mysql_query($sql);
	
	/* Setup page vars for display. */
	if ($page == 0) $page = 1;					//if no page var is given, default to 1.
	$prev = $page - 1;							//previous page is page - 1
	$next = $page + 1;							//next page is page + 1
	$lastpage = ceil($total_pages/$limit);		//lastpage is = total pages / items per page, rounded up.
	$lpm1 = $lastpage - 1;						//last page minus 1
	
	/* 
		Now we apply our rules and draw the pagination object. 
		We're actually saving the code to a variable in case we want to draw it more than once.
	*/

These are where you have to customize the script
